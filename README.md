# MPI-Game-of-Life
Our focus will be on the particular cellular automaton called the (Conway’s) Game of Life, devised by J. H. Conway in 1970. Just “Game” for short. In the Game, we have a 2- dimensional orthogonal grid as a map (i.e. a matrix). Each cell on the map can either contain a creature (1) or be empty (0).
